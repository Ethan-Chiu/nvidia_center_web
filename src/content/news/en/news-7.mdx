# Background

The establishment of the NVIDIA-National Taiwan University Artificial Intelligence Joint Research Center (NVIDIA-NTU AI Center) aims to promote the development and application of artificial intelligence research technology in Taiwan and foster talent. The primary goal of this call-for-project is to connect NVIDIA's high-performance GPU computing resources with National Taiwan University's interdisciplinary research teams, jointly pushing forward the development and application of artificial intelligence technology in Taiwan. It is hoped that this proposal can accelerate the development and realization of AI application technologies and simultaneously cultivate more outstanding talent in artificial intelligence.

# Call for Topics

Generative AI and Digital Twins Applications: Applications related to Generative AI and Digital Twins, including but not limited to its use in music, computer vision, finance, law, and other areas.

# Application Method

From the announcement date until October 31, 2024, please email the application form (see attached file for details) to the following email address:  **nvidia-ntu-applied-research@googlegroups.com**.


# Review Process

The project application will be jointly reviewed by a committee composed of NVIDIA and National Taiwan University (NTU) members. The project review will be based on three main assessment criteria.

1. High-speed Computing Demand and Use of NVIDIA SDK: The review committee will assess the application's need for high-performance computing, prioritizing research applications that require extensive GPU computing resources, and how the application plan effectively utilizes the NVIDIA SDK in its research.

2. Project Impact: The review committee will evaluate the anticipated impact of the application plan on various fields such as science, engineering, or society.

3. Project Feasibility: This includes assessing whether the research plan is practically feasible, such as whether there is a feasible experimental design, sufficient time and resources to complete the research, etc.

A total of five places are expected to be offered for this call-for-project. The committee will complete the review process and announce the results by ~November 30, 2024~ January 31, 2025. The project can last up to 3 months, with a recommended start date no earlier than March 1, 2025.

# Resource

Each selected research project will receive up to three months of computational resource assistance, according to the needs stated in its application and the review results. NVIDIA's professional Solution Architect (SA) team will offer technical guidance. During the execution of the entire core research plan, the SA team will provide technical support during business hours. To obtain the usage rights of computing resources, each selected research project must have at least one member become a contractor of NVIDIA. This member will act as the primary contact person between the team and NVIDIA and will be responsible for handling relevant usage rights matters.

# Rights and Obligations

1. Each research project should cooperate as per the NVIDIA-NTU AI Center's requirements, assisting in understanding and monitoring the project's progress. This includes planning for academic research exchanges, scheduling, and updates on research progress.

2. Within two months of the project's completion, a final report must be submitted. This report should encompass detailed information about the entire project, including but not limited to its objectives, methods, implementation process, findings, and conclusions. The report has no specific format, but its length should be at most 20 pages.

3. Any research outcomes from the selected project, if published in international conferences, academic journals, newspapers, magazines, or exposed on social media, should include a note acknowledging the support from this program. If a collaboration with the NVIDIA SA team has occurred, they should be listed as co-authors in the publication.

4. For intellectual property rights arising from original innovative technologies of the NVIDIA-NTU AI Center or NVIDIA developed through this project, ownership issues will be determined based on the contributions of both parties and the pre-established agreement.

# Matters needing attention

This project provides one-time large-scale computing power, which is especially suited for training large models. However, this computing power type is unsuitable for the inference phase. When participating in this project, it is recommended that teams plan and prepare carefully. For example, teams can gather all the necessary data beforehand and run initial tests and adjustments on smaller models. This way, when they use the large-scale computing power, they can complete the training smoothly and make the most of this valuable resource.
